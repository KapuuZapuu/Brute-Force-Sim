# Password Brute-Force Simulator
The project file can be run by downloading it onto your system and openning it using any web browser installed on your machine. It uses a brute force mechanism built directly into the Javascript section (no imports), and tests user passwords at varying complexities and lengths in order to educate about the importance of password robustness in defending against brute-force attacks. Additionally, there is a built in password strength meter at the end so that users can understand to what degree a password is considered weak, strong, etc.
