# Password Brute-Force Simulator
The project utlizes HTML and CSS for the page content/visuals, and Javascript for the brute-force logic, password strength assessment, and other small functionalities. The brute-force operations will run on the local hardware where the webpage is accessed, therefore if you have an older/slower CPU, it may take longer to complete than normal.

In order to view the project:
1. Download the .zip file onto your system, and decompress it.
2. Open the folder and find the "BruteForceSim.html" file within the "BruteForceProgram" subdirectory.
3. Right-click on the file, and open it with your preferred web browser.
